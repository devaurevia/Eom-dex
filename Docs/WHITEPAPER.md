# EOM DEX Whitepaper

## Abstract
EOM DEX introduces a next-generation decentralized exchange (DEX) designed to eliminate dependency on traditional liquidity pools.  
Our model integrates **escrow-based commitments** and **cross-chain routing** to deliver a fairer, safer, and more transparent trading environment.

---

## Vision
To build a **DEX Gen3** that combines the trust of escrow, the efficiency of CEX, and the openness of DeFi.  
EOM aims to be the go-to venue for both **retail traders** and **institutional partners**, ensuring stability and growth for new tokens and established assets alike.

---

## Problem Statement
- **DEX liquidity traps:** Users can’t trade when liquidity dries up.  
- **CEX opacity:** Centralized exchanges often manipulate orderbooks or hold user funds.  
- **New projects:** Struggle to list without providing deep liquidity upfront.  

---

## Solution
EOM DEX introduces:
1. **Escrow Vaults** – Tokens and stablecoins are locked in third-party escrow, providing trust and preventing rug pulls.  
2. **Controlled Unlock + Burn** – Monthly controlled token releases with up to 50% burn to stabilize supply.  
3. **Fair Launch Support** – New projects join via escrow commitments instead of fake liquidity pools.  
4. **Cross-Chain Integration** – Routing across multiple chains (ETH, BNB, Solana, BTC ecosystem) without slippage beyond 0.1–0.3%.  
5. **Cashback Fees** – Traders receive partial cashback in stablecoins or ecosystem tokens, driving retention.

## Architecture
- **Escrow Layer** – Third-party custody for developer tokens.  
- **Orderbook Engine** – Hybrid on-chain/off-chain orderbook with market-maker support.  
- **Router** – Fastest-path swap across chains and exchanges.  
- **OTC Module** – For whales and institutions to execute large orders with minimal market impact.
