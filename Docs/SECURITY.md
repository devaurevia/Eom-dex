# Security Policy

Security is the backbone of **EOM DEX**.  
Our mission is to provide a platform where users, projects, and institutions can trade with full confidence that funds are safe, contracts are hardened, and governance is protected.  

We operate under the principle:  
**"No trust without verifiable security."**

---

## 1. Audit & Verification

- **Independent Audits**  
  - All core contracts (`OrderBook.sol`, `EscrowVault.sol`, `Governance.sol`) must pass **independent third-party audits** before mainnet launch.  
  - Minimum of two separate audits for critical modules.  
  - Public audit reports will be published in `/audits` for transparency.  

- **Formal Verification**  
  - Selected contracts undergo **formal verification** to mathematically prove correctness of logic and safety of funds.  

- **Continuous Audit Pipeline**  
  - Every major release triggers automated static analysis (Slither, MythX, Foundry).  
  - CI/CD integrates security tests before merge.

## 2. Vulnerability Disclosure Program

We invite the security community to test and help harden EOM DEX.

- Report confidentially to: **security@aurevia.org**  
- High-severity bugs (funds at risk) should be reported immediately with clear reproduction steps.  
- Researchers who report in good faith are protected under our **Safe Harbor Policy** (no legal action).

## 3. Bug Bounty Program

To incentivize security research, we maintain a structured bounty program:

- **Critical** (funds drain, escrow bypass) → Up to $100,000 USD  
- **High** (fund mispricing, governance takeover) → Up to $25,000 USD  
- **Medium** (griefing, DoS on specific modules) → Up to $5,000 USD  
- **Low** (UI spoofing, edge-case issues) → Recognition + swag  

Bounties are paid in **USDT or EOM tokens**, subject to severity and reproducibility.

## 4. Operational Security

- **24/7 Monitoring**: Escrow balances, unlock events, and abnormal activity flagged in real-time.  
- **Multi-sig Treasury**: No single party can unilaterally move funds.  
- **Emergency Circuit Breakers**:  
  - Automatic halt if escrow unlocks exceed thresholds.  
  - Market-by-market pause possible, without freezing user withdrawals.  

---

## 5. Governance & Upgradability

- Governance proposals require **time-locks** before execution.  
- Contract upgrades are gated by **multi-sig with community oversight**.  
- No "god mode" or hidden backdoors.  

---

## 6. Security Culture

- Security-first engineering: audits and tests run in parallel with feature development.  
- Internal “red team” reviews simulate attack vectors before release.  
- Partnership with top security researchers and firms to maintain best practices.

# Our Commitment

Security is not just compliance — it is **our product**.  
EOM DEX will continuously evolve its defenses to stay ahead of threats, ensuring a platform where **liquidity is deep, but attack surface is shallow**.
