## Vision Beyond Year 3  
- Position EOM DEX as a **top 5 global exchange** (DEX + CEX hybrid).  
- Maintain expansion pace: 5–10 new projects/chains per year.  
- Gradually evolve EOM into a **multi-chain liquidity standard** with escrow-first architecture.  
- Focus on acquisition of smaller DEX/CEX to consolidate liquidity.
