# EOM DEX Tokenomics

The **EOM Token** is the core utility and governance asset of the EOM DEX ecosystem.  
It is designed to align incentives across users, developers, and ecosystem partners, while ensuring sustainable liquidity and long-term value growth.

---

## 1) Supply Overview

- **Maximum Supply**: 1,000,000,000 EOM (fixed cap, no future inflation).  
- **Initial Circulating Supply**: ~30% at Token Generation Event (TGE).  
- **Locked Reserve**: ~70% secured inside EscrowVault with controlled unlock schedules.  

Key philosophy: **circulation must grow with adoption, not speculation**.  
Unlocks are gradual, market-adjusted, and combined with a burn policy to ensure deflationary pressure over time.

## 2) Distribution Breakdown

| Allocation        | Percentage | Vesting & Notes                                                                 |
|-------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Seed & Private    | 10%        | 6m cliff, 24m linear vesting. Strategic partners only, no pure speculators.     |
| Public Sale       | 10%        | Fully liquid at launch. Some exchanges may require vesting for compliance.      |
| Team & Advisors   | 10%        | 12m cliff, 36m linear vesting. Designed for long-term alignment.                |
| Aurevia Treasury  | 5%         | For operational runway, compliance, and sustainability (not founder cash-out).  |
| Ecosystem Grants  | 15%        | Incentives for incubated projects, developers, and partnerships.                |
| Escrow Vault Res. | 30%        | Liquidity backstop; tokens unlocked with ≥50% burn applied each time.           |
| Community Rewards | 20%        | Airdrops, cashback, referral programs, and affiliate incentives.                 |

**Notes:**  
- Treasury allocation belongs to the corporate entity (Aurevia), not individuals.  
- Escrow reserves are critical: they protect markets from thin liquidity and provide emergency fills.  
- Team tokens are strictly vested, preventing early dumping.

## 3) Unlock & Burn Policy

- **Unlocks**  
  - Flexible, tied to real adoption and market demand.  
  - Default target: ~1% supply per month (adjustable via governance).  
  - Unlock pace may slow during weak markets or accelerate during strong growth.  

- **Burn Mechanism**  
  - Minimum 50% of tokens released at each unlock are permanently destroyed.  
  - Example: If 10M tokens are unlocked, at least 5M are burned.  

- **Buyback & Burn**  
  - A share of platform profits (from trading fees or OTC desk) may be used to repurchase EOM from the market and burn.  

This ensures a **deflationary cycle**:  
growth → more usage → more unlocks/burns → shrinking supply → stronger long-term token value.

## 4) Token Utility

### a) Governance
- EOM holders vote on:  
  - Listing approvals.  
  - Fee adjustments.  
  - Treasury usage.  
  - Escrow burn ratio.  
- Governance is progressive: starts with multisig + community input, evolves to fully on-chain voting.

### b) Trading Fee Discounts & Cashback
- Base platform fee: **0.35%** per transaction.  
- Active users can receive **monthly cashback up to 0.05%** of trading volume.  
- Cashback is distributed in EOM tokens from the community pool.  

### c) Staking
- Lock EOM tokens to share in platform revenue.  
- Target allocation: **30% of platform profit** flows to staking rewards.  
- Stakers benefit from deflationary burns + yield, aligning incentives for long-term holders.  

### d) Affiliate & Referral Rewards
- Affiliates earn a percentage of fees generated by their referrals.  
- Part of these rewards are paid in EOM tokens, driving adoption and visibility.  

### e) Escrow Liquidity Support
- EscrowVault uses reserved tokens to backstop thin markets.  
- Prevents “failed transactions” due to lack of counterparties.  
- Builds confidence among new projects launching on EOM.

## 5) Sustainability & Revenue Model

**Revenue Sources:**
1. Trading fees (0.35% maker/taker).  
2. OTC desk fees (discounted path for large trades).  
3. Expansion & listing fees (for new projects/chains).  
4. Potential premium services (API, analytics, incubation).  

**Stability Drivers:**
- Escrow-backed liquidity ensures projects cannot “rug” overnight.  
- Continuous burns reduce long-term supply.  
- Cashback + staking rewards recycle revenue back to the community.  

**Long-Term Flywheel:**
1. Higher volume →  
2. More fees collected →  
3. More burns + more rewards →  
4. Stronger token value →  
5. More adoption + new listings →  
6. Cycle repeats at larger scale.

## 6) Example Scenarios

### Case A: Conservative Baseline (Aligned with Whitepaper)
- **Timeline**: Year 2 target.  
- **Average Daily Volume**: $200M.  
- **Fee Revenue**: $200M × 0.35% = $700k/day ≈ $21M/month.  
- **Cashback Pool**: ~0.05% → ~$3M/month returned to users.  
- **Burns**: If ~0.5% supply unlocked monthly, ~5M tokens destroyed each month.  

### Case B: Aggressive Adoption
- **Timeline**: Potentially Year 1 if adoption exceeds expectations.  
- **Average Daily Volume**: $200M+ earlier than baseline.  
- **Fee Revenue**: Same as above, but accelerated timeline.  
- **Impact**: Faster staking rewards, earlier deflationary pressure, stronger community traction.

## 7) Strategic Role of the Token

- **Not just speculative**: EOM has direct utility across escrow, governance, cashback, staking, and referral programs.  
- **Trust-first design**: Escrow and burns create transparency and stability.  
- **Growth alignment**: Supply expansion tied directly to adoption, preventing runaway inflation.

# Summary

The EOM Token is more than a governance coin — it is a **multi-role asset** designed for:  
- **Trust** (escrow liquidity backstop).  
- **Engagement** (cashback, staking, affiliate rewards).  
- **Deflationary growth** (burn mechanics + buybacks).  

This model ensures that as the platform grows, **value accrues to both users and token holders**, while maintaining strict controls to avoid inflation and speculation-driven collapses.
