# EOM DEX Litepaper

## Vision
EOM DEX is a Gen3 decentralized exchange that removes dependency on pooled liquidity. Trading runs through a hybrid orderbook + escrow mechanism to keep markets fair, transparent, and efficient for both retail and institutions.

## Core Innovations
- No Liquidity Pools — prevents rug-pulls and impermanent loss; pure buyer–seller matching.
- Escrow Vault — locked project assets provide settlement safety and natural liquidity.
- Competitive Fees — base trading fee 0.35% with optional monthly cashback for active users.
- Cross-Chain Ready — initial focus on ETH, BNB, SOL, and BTC ecosystem; expandable to new L1/L2.
- Institutional OTC — large orders executed with minimal market impact and clear audit trail.

## Token Utility (EOM)
- Trading fee discounts for holders/stakers.
- Governance over listings, integrations, and fee tiers.
- Rewards budget for staking and affiliate programs.
- Buyback-and-burn policy to sustain long-term scarcity.

## Market Structure
- Hybrid orderbook with market-maker support under strict risk and fairness rules.
- Third-party escrow for project commitments; devs never hold user funds directly.
- Router selects best venue across integrated chains and venues.

## Roadmap (High Level)
- Year 1: Testnet launch, core DEX live, top-tier coin integrations, first 1,000 active users.
- Year 2: Expand to 3–5 new chains, reach ~$200M daily volume, ship OTC and cross-chain aggregator.
- Year 3: Global scale, strengthen partner ecosystem, position as top-tier DEX alternative.

## Security and Compliance
- Independent smart-contract audits and continuous scanning.
- Coordinated vulnerability disclosure and bug bounty.
- Third-party custodial escrow for project funds to reduce counterparty risk.

## Closing
EOM DEX aligns the efficiency of CEX with the openness of DeFi. By combining escrow-based safety, cross-chain routing, and pragmatic tokenomics, EOM targets sustainable growth rather than short-lived hype.
